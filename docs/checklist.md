# Project ChecklistThis checklist is organized by phase. Each phase has entry criteria and completion criteria to keep work sequenced and verifiable.---## Phase 0 — Time rules and foundational decisions### GoalsLock and document the time/session/bucketing rules that drive schema and ingestion.### Completed- [x] Choose canonical interval: 1-minute bars- [x] Choose derived interval: 30-minute bars- [x] Define session boundaries (CT):  - [x] ON: 17:00:00–08:29:59  - [x] RTH: 08:30:00–15:59:59- [x] Define trading date rollover (CT 17:00 -> next trading date)- [x] Choose stored timestamp representation: `ts_start_utc` epoch seconds INTEGER- [x] Decide CT helper fields:  - [x] `trading_date_ct_int` (YYYYMMDD integer)  - [x] `ct_minute_of_day` (0..1439)- [x] Define 30-minute bucket alignment (CT wall-clock half-hours)- [x] Define 30m `period_index` rules for ON and RTH- [x] Confirm RTH includes 15:30–16:00 bucket; 16:00+ is out-of-session for v1### Deliverables- [x] `docs/time_rules.md`- [x] `docs/decisions.md`### Deferred- [ ] Define “breach” precisely for rolling breach analytics (up/down/either; strict vs touch)- [ ] Decide whether early closes/holidays must be modeled for v1---## Phase 1 — Project skeleton and architecture### GoalsCreate the repo structure and boundaries that prevent coupling and rework.### Checklist- [x] Create `src/` application structure (domain / services / repositories / web / cli)- [ ] Add configuration loader (env-driven settings)- [ ] Add SQL loader utility for “loaded repositories”- [ ] Establish logging approach (simple, consistent)- [ ] Add test harness (pytest) and `tests/` layout- [ ] Add basic CI hooks/scripts (format/test)### Deliverables- [ ] File tree in place (documented in README)- [ ] “Hello page” route renders a template (FastAPI + templates)- [ ] One minimal CLI command wired (even if it’s stubbed)---## Phase 2 — Schema spec and migrations (SQLite)### GoalsImplement schema and indexes consistent with Phase 0 time rules.### Checklist- [ ] Draft `docs/schema.md` (tables, columns, constraints, indexes)- [ ] Implement migrations / schema creation scripts- [ ] Confirm constraints:  - bars_1m uniqueness: (instrument_id, ts_start_utc)  - bars_30m uniqueness: (instrument_id, bucket_start_utc)- [ ] Add indexes for range scans and day/session queries- [ ] Add DB connection setup and pragmas (documented)### Deliverables- [ ] Schema can be created from scratch locally- [ ] Tests can spin up a temp DB and create schema---## Phase 3 — CLI importer + derived 30m refresh### GoalsDeterministic ingestion pipeline with audit trail and derived 30m rebuild.### Checklist- [ ] Define CLI contract (flags: file, symbol, timezone, merge policy)- [ ] Parse/validate CSV (types, missing values, bounds)- [ ] Compute: ts_start_utc, trading_date_ct_int, ct_minute_of_day- [ ] Upsert into bars_1m (skip/overwrite)- [ ] Rebuild/upsert bars_30m for affected range (set-based)- [ ] Compute and store: period_index (+ optional tpo label)- [ ] Persist import audit row (counts + bounds)- [ ] Add integration test: import → query sample rows### Deliverables- [ ] End-to-end import works reliably- [ ] Derived 30m rows match aggregation rules---## Phase 4 — Core analytics (ported from existing project)### GoalsRebuild core stats to operate on SQL-backed data (30m-based analyses).### Checklist- [ ] Identify v1 analyses to include (top 3–5)- [ ] Implement analytics services returning structured outputs- [ ] Add tests for edge cases and expected outputs- [ ] Add REST endpoints for analytics outputs (even if UI consumes directly)### Deliverables- [ ] Stats view renders tables from real data---## Phase 5 — Signature analytics (1m breakout/retrace and gaps)### GoalsImplement the standout 1m-based analysis to differentiate the portfolio project.### Checklist- [ ] Implement breakout/retrace stats (ON/RTH/full day)- [ ] Implement optional gap stats at 1m- [ ] Handle missing/partial data explicitly- [ ] Add tests for representative scenarios### Deliverables- [ ] Signature report page renders and matches expected logic---## Phase 6 — UI pages + Plotly charts### GoalsDeliver a usable, navigable UI with interactive charts and htmx updates.### Checklist- [ ] Base layout template + navigation- [ ] Dataset overview page (symbols, coverage, last import)- [ ] Core stats page (tables)- [ ] Rolling breach chart page:  - [ ] date range controls  - [ ] multi-symbol compare  - [ ] Plotly chart rendering  - [ ] htmx fragment updates### Deliverables- [ ] Demo-ready UI with at least one interactive chart---## Phase 7 — Docker + deploy readiness### GoalsRun locally in Docker and enable a straightforward VPS deployment later.### Checklist- [ ] Dockerfile for app- [ ] docker-compose for local run (persistent SQLite volume)- [ ] README run instructions (local + Docker)- [ ] Backup/restore notes for SQLite file- [ ] Deployment notes targeting a low-cost VPS### Deliverables- [ ] Reviewer can run the app from scratch using README
